## Features

- **Custom Step Value:** Increase or decrease the counter by a user-defined step.
- **History Tracking:** Keeps a record of all previous counter values and displays them in a list.
- **Auto Counter:** Automatically increments the counter at regular intervals using a timer.
- **Persistent Storage:** Saves the counter value in localStorage to maintain state even after page refresh.

## Technologies Used

- **React** (JSX, Hooks: `useState`, `useEffect`)
